Trashcan Gourmand is a tool to help you remember your projects by sending you a randomly chosen bit of source code from a project every day.

Every day it causes you to email yourself the image of an individual source file from a project which you choose. Because there is no hosting and it is all done on your machine, there are many fewer security concerns.

It has been my experience that my judgment of a source file's importance to a project has been terrible, so this tool chooses source files completely randomly, given a filetype or filetypes. This is eating from the trashcan of your project.
