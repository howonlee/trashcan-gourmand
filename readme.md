Trashcan Gourmand is a tool to help you remember your projects by sending you a randomly chosen bit of source code from a project every day.

Every day it causes you to email yourself the image of an individual source file from a project which you choose. Because there is no hosting and it is all done on your machine, there are many fewer security concerns.
